                        VPS stands for Virtual Private Server and VPS Hosting is a website hosting environment which
                        allows for resources like RAM and CPU to be dedicated to your account.
                        A VPS server is a better choice when you are searching for control and flexibility around your
                        site.
                        It is similar to having your own Dedicated Server, however it is virtual i.e. achieved by
                        virtualizing a Dedicated Server and splitting the resources amongst the users on that server.
                        A VPS will have a slice of the total resources on a hardware node and is popular because of the
                        affordability of gaining access to more resources and control of your own server without the
                        full costs of dedicated.
                        So, VPS Hosting is a dedicated control and functionality in a scalable hosting environment.

                <ul class="mx-3 advantages">
                    <li><strong>Guaranteed Resources -</strong> Users are guaranteed the resources on their
                        VPS Hosting account i.e. your account will always be allocated the set amount of CPU, RAM and
                        Disk Space you have selected regardless of what other users on the server are doing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Greater Stability & Improved Performance –</strong>VPS Hosting allows for
                        greater stability & improved performance of your site. You don’t share resources with any other
                        users meaning your audience will enjoy your enhanced website performance in a VPS environment
                        i.e. providing better security for your website files.</li>
                    <li><strong>More Control –</strong>VPS Hosting allows you to configure server setting
                        at any time, if you need to install any server applications. Your own VPS may be restarted
                        without impact upon others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy –</strong>Privacy is one of the most affecting factors when
                        comparing Shared Hosting Vs. VPS Hosting. In VPS Hosting your operating system is not shared
                        with anyone else, and there is no chance of anyone else being able to access or view your files.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Completely Dedicated Resources –</strong>When you use a VPS Server, you
                        will benefit from dedicated RAM which is only available to you i.e. most of the benefits of a
                        Dedicated Server, without the cost. So, VPS Hosting is cost effectiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Highly Scalable –</strong>As your website becomes more famous, you may also
                        easily enhance your VPS resources to keep up with growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customization Capabilities –</strong>With VPS Hosting you will have your
                        own operating system & you will also have various VPS Server applications like MySQL, PHP and
                        Apache. You may customized any of these services at any time.</li>
