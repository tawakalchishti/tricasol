                                <div class="dedicated-text">Reseller hosting is essentially a way for you to purchase
                                    hosting resources from us in bulk and then to re-sell those resources directly to
                                    your clients. You can set limitations on disk space, bandwidth, email usage, and
                                    other features on a per-package or per-site basis. We provide a completely managed
                                    service from a technical perspective - the server space, hosting resources and
                                    support come from us and you are responsible for supporting your end-user clients.
                                    You can even brand your clients' cPanels with your own logo for a super professional
                                    image.

                                    But reseller hosting isn’t just for web designers, agencies and start-up hosting
                                    companies - it’s also a great option if you run a lot of websites personally.
                                    Because you have access to WHM, you can create each site with its own separate
                                    cPanel. This means each site or client gets their own login to manage their own
                                    hosting settings, isolating them completely from other users on the same server or
                                    under your account. This improves site performance and resiliency from malware
                                    attacks.

                                    We do place some restrictions on what can be hosted through our reseller servers,
                                    though there are only a few instances. These include typical tube sites, copyrighted
                                    content, P2P sharing, and crypto mining. Simply ask us and we’ll let you know what’s
                                    on the cards and what isn’t; we’re always available.

                                    This depends on the package you choose. The short answer, though, is yes. We cater
