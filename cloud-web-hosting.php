                                    Yes, you can upgrade from shared hosting to cloud hosting and you’ll be able to
                                    migrate your website to it. If you use a control panel like cPanel, you’ll also be
                                    able to manage your site in the usual way.

                                    Before making the decision, however, you should consider whether your business is at
                                    the stage where it needs all the resources of the cloud. You may just need a bigger
                                    shared hosting plan or a move to VPS hosting.
